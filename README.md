# OpenGL
Some of the OpenGL 3.3 tutorials I've been following from www.learnopengl.com/

Also included is a dependencies folder that houses several important OpenGL libraries, includes, and binaries (GLFW, GLEW, GLM, SOIL, SDL2, possibly Qt). If you're looking to get started and are creating an OpenGL context for the first time I highly recommend you take a look in the dependencies folder.

Note: some binaries were built using CMake and then compiled using Visual Studio Community 2015 (aka VS 14). It's probably better to build/compile your own bins and libs specifically for your own system.
