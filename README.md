# OpenGL
Some of the OpenGL 3.3 tutorials I've been following from www.learnopengl.com/

Also included is a dependencies folder that houses several important OpenGL libraries, includes, and binaries (GLFW, GLEW, GLM, SOIL, SDL2, possibly Qt). If you're looking to get started and are creating an OpenGL context for the first time I highly recommend you take a look in the dependencies folder.
